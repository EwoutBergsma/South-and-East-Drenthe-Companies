I scraped companies from Google Maps.

Some other companies that I found:
https://www.iotnederland.nl/

See the `.csv` for all the IT companies that I found. Sometimes there are duplicates in URl, that's a bug in my code, I do not have time to fix this yet. They are pretty obvious though.

Google Maps also returned companies that are outside of south east Drenthe, I do not think I can change that.
